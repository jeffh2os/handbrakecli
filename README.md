HandbrakeCli bash script with variables to do batch conversion.

Reqruies HandbrakeCLI from : https://handbrake.fr/

This script can be placed anywhere.
The variables in the first half will need adjusted to your environment.
Make sure to use full paths. 

I have added all video and audio codecs possible with HandbrakeCLI as of the creation of this script.

There only variables currently are video/audio and subtitles.
